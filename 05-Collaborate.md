## Intro to Pandas and Seaborn

Two good chapters from Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas

* [03.00 Introduction to Pandas](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/03.00-Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb)
* [04.14 Visualization with Seaborn](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/04.14-Visualization-With-Seaborn.ipynb)

And if you google "seaborn bar charts" you'll get...

* [seaborn.barplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html) API reference docs -- pydata.org

## git branch

* [git-branch.md](git-branch.md)

## Reading

The [Atlassian website](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) has nice tutorials on collaborating with git. 
Although they don't use github, the differences are minimal. 
In advance of class next week, work through the following three tutorials...

* [Collaborating](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing)
* [Making a Pull Request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request)
* [Using Branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)
* Their [git cheat sheet](file:///Users/pbogden/Desktop/Git-Cheatsheet.pdf) (pdf) is pretty good
