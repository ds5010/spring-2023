## Goals

* File I/O with built-in functions and methods
* Data manipulation with built-in data types
* Intro to data viz with matplotlib

## Verify requirements

Verify that students have basic requirements (python, conda, git) as specified in 01-Intro.md

* conda with data science tools (anaconda or miniconda) installed
* REPL and an editor/IDE (Note the sad news about atom:-(
* git on the command line

## Python data viz -- overview

* [Python Data Viz](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries) in 2018
  * Part II: [Emerging trends](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/python-data-visualization-2018-moving-toward-convergence)
  * Part III: [Where do we go from here?](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/python-data-visualization-2018-where-do-we-go-from-here)
    * "I proposed my PyViz.org initiative as one step in that direction, with HoloViews and GeoViews providing a single and concise high-level declarative data API for using multiple InfoVis libraries..."
    * "Ben Root, representing Matplotlib, suggested that the large number of existing libraries was not necessarily an issue. He believes it’s entirely appropriate for Matplotlib to be the core workhorse for a large number of libraries building on it—not everything needs to be in Matplotlib itself, and Matplotlib makes an excellent basis on which to build other, higher-level 2D static-plotting functionality, due to its comprehensive support for low-level primitives and output formats."
    * "Noelle Held, from the audience, argued that her scientific colleagues have indeed been totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of plotting possibilities in Python, yet she saw the benefit of having so many different libraries available. It seems unlikely that all the separate package authors would be able to coordinate closely, but perhaps the SciPy community could do better at educating users..."
    * "Maarten Breddels, representing ipyvolume, bqplot, and ipywidgets, argued that ipywidgets (aka Jupyter widgets) is already emerging as a de facto standard, supported by a wide range of libraries (ipyvolume, ipyleaflet, pythreejs, bqplot, and now Plotly) that can now be mixed and matched as needed to provide interactive apps and plots in a Jupyter notebook."
    * Conclusions and Outlook: "Overall, it was clear that each of the main libraries represents a vibrant community of users and developers using different techniques to achieve different goals."
