## vscode and make

* [vscode.md](vscode.md) shows how to make vscode behave like a text editor, which helps with Makefiles.

## Assignment

* Check Canvas -- due 31 Jan
* For 31 Jan -- complete the quakes assignment (below) and migrate the code to the github-classroom repo.
* Follow the instructions and use the format described in the repo.
* Use this [git-intro](https://github.com/ds5110/git-intro) as guidance for organizing your own.

## Continued from last time

* 03-penguins-exercises
* Migrate this to github (see the canvas assignment)

## Assignment -- due Friday, 27 Jan

* Demonstrate the ability to clone the repo locally from the command line
* Edit the README.md
* Commit the changes and push them back to github
* That means authenticating somehow
  * [github authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication)
  * Github seems to recommend SSH, and that may be the preferred way to go (I use personal access tokens on a Mac)
  * With SSH, you can use an SH "agent" to manage SSH keys and passphrases (see the github documentation)
